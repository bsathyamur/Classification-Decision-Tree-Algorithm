# Classification-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
Decision tree algorithm falls under the category of supervised learning. They can be used to solve both regression and classification problem. The algorithm is implemented by computing the entropy and information gain.

This program aims at implementing the decision tree algorithm without the use of scikitlearn or other python build packages for decision tree algorithm
